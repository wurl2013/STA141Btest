# Education
I am a graduate student from University of California, Davis. I double-majored in Statistics and Horticulture & Agronomy. My research focuses mainly agroecology. Recently, I am focusing on finish my thesis, which is about modelling the reproduction time and biomass of California grassland. The model is developed based on field observed data in Davis, a vegetation model developed by Jouven et al., and some concepts in irrigation. This model is able to predict the daily biomass per hacter from Jan to June for given grass species characterstics, weather and soil conditions.

For Statistics, I am interested in Nonlinear Models in Ecology, Models in Population Biology, Data Visualization, and Geostatistics. I am proficient in R and Python. 

In UC Davis, I also worked as TA and GSR. Before UC Davis, I was an undergraduate student in Zhejiang Univerysity, China, where I studied environmental chemistry and plant physiology.

I plan to graduate in June. Currently, I am seeking opportunities as a statistician in agriculture, environment or other related fields, feel free to contact at <a href="mailto:rlwu@ucdavis.edu">rlwu@ucdavis.edu</a>
