# Education
I am a graduate student from University of California, Davis. I double-majored in Statistics and Horticulture & Agronomy. My research focuses mainly agroecology. Recently apart from my coursework, I am focusing on finish my thesis, which is about modelling the reproduction time and biomass of California grassland. 

For Statistics, I am interested in Nonlinear Models in Ecology studies, Mathmatical Models in Population Biology, Data Visualization, and Geostatistics.I am proficient in R and Python. In UC Davis, I also worked as TA and GSR. Before UC Davis, I was an undergraduate student in Zhejiang Univerysity, China, where I studied environmental chemistry and plant physiology.

I plan to graduate in June. Currently, I am seeking opportunities as a statistician in agriculture, environment or other related fields. feel free to contact at <a href="mailto:rlwu@ucdavis.edu">rlwu@ucdavis.edu</a>
